## Automated UI Testing with Selenium and JavaScript

This repository contains automated UI test cases for the KloudShip application. The tests are implemented using Selenium WebDriver and JavaScript. Two test cases are covered:

### Test Case 01: Add Package

**Steps:** Login, navigate to "Package Types," add a package, and logout.

**Expected:** The created package is visible after login.

### Test Case 02: Delete Package

**Steps:** Login, navigate to "Package Types," delete a package, and logout.

**Expected:** The deleted package isn't visible after login.

### Setup and Run:

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Clone the repo: `git clone <repository-url>`.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Configure WebDriver for your browser.
5. Update scripts with URLs and credentials.
6. Run tests: `node <script-name>.js`.

### Challenges:

- **WebDriver Setup:** Configuring WebDriver for the browser can be tricky.
- **Element Locators:** Identifying HTML elements might be challenging.
- **Stability:** Tests can be affected by network latency and UI changes.
- **Authentication:** Handling CAPTCHA or tokens can be complex.
- **Test Data:** Generating dynamic test data may require effort.
- **Maintenance:** Regularly updating tests for app changes can be time-consuming.

## Automated API Testing with Postman and Newman

This repository contains automated API test cases for the KloudShip application using Postman collections and Newman. Import the provided collection, configure variables, and run tests via Newman. Verify responses meet expectations and maintain the collection for API changes.

### Setup and Run:

1. Install Newman globally: `npm install -g newman`.
2. Clone the repo, import and configure the collection.
3. Run tests: `newman run <exported-collection-file.json>`.

Contributions welcome via pull requests or issues.

A concise step-by-step process along with potential hurdles you might face while working with SQL queries:

**Step-by-step Process:**
1. **Understand Requirements:** Begin by thoroughly understanding the requirements of the SQL queries you need to write.

2. **Data Schema Analysis:** Examine the database schema to identify the relevant tables, their relationships, and the columns needed for your queries.

3. **Write Queries:** Craft SQL queries using appropriate SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, and other clauses to extract the required data as specified in the tasks.

4. **Test Queries:** Execute the queries in a safe environment (like a testing database) to verify correctness. Use sample data if available.

5. **Optimize Performance:** Optimize your queries for performance. Consider indexing, using proper JOIN types, and minimizing data retrieval.

6. **Error Handling:** Account for potential errors, such as non-existent data or invalid queries. Implement error-handling mechanisms where necessary.

**Hurdles Faced:**
1. **Complex Joins:** Creating complex JOIN statements across multiple tables can become challenging, especially when dealing with large datasets. Ensuring the correct relationships are maintained is crucial.

2. **Data Integrity:** Dealing with data integrity issues, like missing or inconsistent data, can lead to unexpected results. Ensuring data accuracy is essential.

3. **Performance Bottlenecks:** Poorly optimized queries might lead to slow performance. Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks can be time-consuming.

4. **Writing Complex Logic:** Formulating logic to meet the query requirements without causing logic errors can be complex and error-prone.

5. **Subqueries and Aggregates:** Incorporating subqueries and aggregate functions requires a clear understanding of how to structure these queries correctly.

Remember to test your queries extensively and collaborate with colleagues or reference resources (such as documentation and forums) to overcome hurdles and ensure accurate and efficient SQL queries.
